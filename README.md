<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm ShahRiffy!</h1>

I'm a self-taught computer science enthusiast based in Dhaka, Bangladesh. I'm a  researcher and  member of the RevoltZero .


##  My interests span a wide range of areas, including:
-  Computer Security: I'm fascinated by the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity.
-  Natural Language Processing (NLP): Exploring the frontiers of human-computer language interaction.
-  Game Development: Building immersive digital experiences for fun and learning.
-  Robotics: Delving into the world of intelligent machines and automation.


 I'm an active participant in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions. As a member of 'TheResurrectedOdyssey,' we achieved 4th place in MIST LEETCON: HackMeIfYouCan, ranked 6th in the National Cyber Drill 2021, and secured 4th place in RIoT Center Flag Hunt 2022.


 I've also had the privilege to contribute as a problem setter for various local and international CTF competitions, including 
 - KnightCTF 2022 (Intl) 
 - BDSec CTF 2022
 - KnightCTF 2021 (Intl).



ðŸš€ Join me on my journey as I explore the exciting world of technology and contribute to the cybersecurity and CTF community. Let's collaborate and make the digital world a safer and more interesting place!
